## Tools

   * MuDNN: <https://github.com/microsoft/MMdnn>
      * MMdnn is a set of tools to help users inter-operate among different deep learning frameworks. E.g. model conversion and visualization. Convert models between Caffe, Keras, MXNet, Tensorflow, CNTK, PyTorch Onnx and CoreML.

   * AIF360: <https://github.com/IBM/AIF360>, <http://aif360.mybluemix.net/>
      * A comprehensive set of fairness metrics for datasets and machine learning models, explanations for these metrics, and algorithms to mitigate bias in datasets and models. 
   * sotabench: <https://sotabench.com>
      * A free benchmarking service for all open source ML repositories. You can submit your model and this web will run it against some benchmakrs.
   * Paper with Code: <https://paperswithcode.com/sota>
      * A website contains evalution results reported in DL/ML papers, as well as their code (if any). Note the code could be implemented by 3rd party.
